# Kanban Board App

## Overview

This project is a Kanban board application built using ReactJS. It allows users to interact with ticket data fetched from the [Quicksell API](https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment). Users can group and sort tickets based on different criteria, making it a versatile tool for project management.
